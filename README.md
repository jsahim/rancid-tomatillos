# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract
 [//]: <>
 This app was built to view movies with their ratings and details. As a user you can go to the site and view all the movies on display with their ratings. You can then click into a movie and see its details and, when available, a trailer with its backdrop image behind. You can then click the home button  or the website logo and title to return to the main page. As a user you can utilize the search bar feature to search through the movies. You can click the user Icon at the top of the page to be taken to a user-page that is currently in production for additional features.
